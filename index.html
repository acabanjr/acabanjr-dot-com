<div class="content">
			<p>As a kid, I had a book full of “My Inventions,” a binder divided into various categories. It was full of my ideas. Detailed mock-ups ranging from clothing designs to video game concepts, and even blueprints for skyscrapers. I’ve always been creative and even more so, organized. These adjectives define my character and guide my approach to even the smallest details.</p>

          <div class="parallax-content">FASHION DESIGN</div>
      	</div>
			
			<p>My nearly two-decade long career in fashion began with the decision to embrace creative roles over technical ones. Despite initial concerns about their lucrative differences, that choice has continued to enrich my creative spirit, allowed me to channel my passion into various avenues, and has proven advantageous.</p>

			<p>As a fashion designer, I conceptualize collections from inspiration to technical and illustrative sketches, for boys, men, and young men. I’m also skilled in graphic, print, fabric, and technical design. Throughout my career, I've contributed to a diverse assortment of projects. Designing and marketing a men’s fashion accessory brand, building and maintaining a custom-fashion e-commerce website and fashion blog, refining design processes, and designing business headquarters.</p>

          <div class="parallax-content">INTERIORS</div>
      	</div>

			<p>My design eye extends beyond fashion and into interiors. Whether at home or in the office, my space is almost always the neatest, cleanest, and most thoughtfully arranged. If my career hadn’t led me down the path of fashion, it likely would have steered me toward interior design.</p>
	
			<p>Interior design has been important to me for as long as I can remember. As an adolescent living at home, I would regularly repaint, redecorate, and rearrange my room. The same passion carried over when I lived on my own, and it continues now, living with my wife.</p>
	
			<p>In a professional capacity, I’ve had the opportunity to design and oversee multiple office space projects, as well as contribute to the creation of various furniture designs.</p>
	
      	<div class="parallax parallax3">
          <div class="parallax-content">TECHNOLOGY</div>
      	</div>

			<p>"What do you want to be when you grow up?" My answer to that question changed often as a kid. My earliest dream career was as a cartoonist. I used to draw all the time, and it’s something I regret letting go of. I’ve always been a creative person, though I wouldn’t call myself an artist. Maybe one day, I’ll pick it up again. Another aspiration I remember is wanting to be an architect, but eventually, I landed on “a computer programmer.”</p>

			<p>I’ve always been tech-savvy, though I believe that’s less about innate talent and more about curiosity. I love to tinker, research, and dive into settings—exploring and learning organically along the way. While I enjoyed the programming courses I took in high school and college, I ultimately decided against becoming a programmer. Even though it’s considered a lucrative career, it wasn’t enough of a passion for me to make it such a defining part of my life.</p>
	
			<p>That said, technology still feels second nature to me and plays a vital role in bringing my creative projects to life. It’s been instrumental in efficiently executing so many of my ideas. In fact, I designed and built this very website using modern, openly available technologies.</p>
	
      	<div class="parallax parallax4">

      	</div>	
	
			<p>I approach social media with responsibility, mindful of the impact my words and actions can have. To me, it’s a window into my world, where I prioritize sharing moments that reflect my passions, experiences, and creativity rather than spreading memes, political opinions, or negative content.</p>
				
			<p>By keeping my profiles public, I invite both friends and strangers alike to catch a glimpse of my journey and connect through shared interests or values. It’s a space where I strive to inspire others by showcasing the beauty I find in everyday life—whether through photography, art, or personal stories—while also drawing inspiration from the community of people who share their own unique journeys online.</p>

          <div class="parallax-content">CHILDREN'S BOOK</div>
      	</div>	

			<p>I've always been drawn to creative pursuits. My combination of imagination and meticulous organization has shaped both my career and personal journeys. My passion for writing began in my teenage years, fueled by poetry and a love for essays. Though writing a book has been a long-held goal, it wasn't until recently that the idea for a children's book took root. After careful thought, especially regarding the illustrations, I'm proud to share my debut children's book, The Garden of Beliefs, blending my love for storytelling with visual art.</p>

					<p><em>Daisy the Daffodil embarks on a journey through a magical garden where every flower represents a unique belief.

      	</div>	

			<p>Travel is a powerful way to open people’s minds. It exposes us to different cultures, perspectives, and ways of life, helping us better understand the world and the diversity of people who inhabit it. Experiencing new places and meeting people from all walks of life can break down barriers and broaden our horizons. If travel were more accessible, it could play a significant role in reducing prejudices and fostering greater empathy, helping us see beyond stereotypes and appreciate the richness of different cultures.</p>
	
			<p>Personally, I’ve found great joy in recording video of my travels, capturing the moments that define each place. Editing the footage and sharing it on social media allows me to relive the experiences while offering others a glimpse into the parts of the world I’ve been fortunate enough to explore. It’s my way of preserving memories and inviting others to see the beauty in the diversity and uniqueness of the world around us.</p>
